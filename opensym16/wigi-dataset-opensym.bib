	abstract = {Wikipedia is one of the most successful examples of massive collaborative content development. However, many of the mechanisms and procedures that it uses are still unknown in detail. For instance, how equal (or unequal) are the contributions to it has been discussed in the last years, with no conclusive results. In this paper, we study exactly that aspect by using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, very well known instruments to economists. We analyze the trends in the inequality of distributions for the ten biggest language editions of Wikipedia, and their evolution over time. As a result, we have found large differences in the number of contributions by different authors (something also observed in free, open source software development), and a trend to stable patterns of inequality in the long run.},

	abstract = {In 2000, the Cohn-Kanade (CK) database was released for the purpose of promoting research into automatically detecting individual facial expressions. Since then, the CK database has become one of the most widely used test-beds for algorithm development and evaluation. During this period, three limitations have become apparent: 1) While AU codes are well validated, emotion labels are not, as they refer to what was requested rather than what was actually performed, 2) The lack of a common performance metric against which to evaluate new algorithms, and 3) Standard protocols for common databases have not emerged. As a consequence, the CK database has been used for both AU and emotion detection (even though labels for the latter have not been validated), comparison with benchmark algorithms is missing, and use of random subsets of the original database makes meta-analyses difficult. To address these and other concerns, we present the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database. The number of sequences is increased by 22 \% and the number of subjects by 27\%. The target expression for each sequence is fully FACS coded and emotion labels have been revised and validated. In addition to this, non-posed sequences for several types of smiles and their associated metadata have been added. We present baseline results using Active Appearance Models (AAMs) and a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier using a leaveone-out subject cross-validation for both AU and emotion detection for the posed data. The emotion and AU labels, along with the extended image data and tracked landmarks will be made available July 2010. 1.},

	abstract = {At least since Priestley's 1765 Chart of Biography, large numbers of individual person records have been used to illustrate aggregate patterns of cultural history. Wikidata, the structured database sister of Wikipedia, currently contains about 2.7 million explicit person records, across all language versions of the encyclopedia. These individuals, notable according to Wikipedia editing criteria, are connected via millions of hyperlinks between their respective Wikipedia articles. This situation provides us with the chance to go beyond the illustration of an idiosyncratic subset of individuals, as in the case of Priestly. In this work we summarize the overlap of nationalities and occupations, based on their co-occurrence in Wikidata individuals. We construct networks of co-occurring nationalities and occupations, provide insights into their respective community structure, and apply the results to select and color chronologically structured subsets of a large network of individuals, connected by Wikipedia hyperlinks. While the imagined communities of nationality are much more discrete in terms of co-occurrence than occupations, our quantifications reveal the existing overlap of nationality as much less clear-cut than in case of occupational domains. Our work contributes to a growing body of research using biographies of notable persons to analyze cultural processes.},

We analyzed coverage of Wikipedia's gender gap by 42 U.S. news organizations and blogs as well as 1,336 comments posted online by readers. We also interviewed Wikimedia Foundation executive director Sue Gardner. Commentators questioned Wikipedia's epistemology and culture and associated the gap with societal issues and/or (perceived) gender differences regarding time management, self-confidence, and expertise, as well as personality and interests. Yet, many commentators denied the gap was a problem; they blamed women for not joining, suggested it was women's choice, or mocked girly interests. The belittling of the disparity as feminist ideology arguably betrays an antifeminist backlash.},

	abstract = {Contributing to history has never been as easy as it is today. Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia. Wikipedia, available in many languages, is one of the most visited websites in the world and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. However, not everyone is contributing to Wikipedia from a diversity point of view; several groups are severely underrepresented. One of those groups is women, who make up approximately 16\% of the current contributor community, meaning that most of the content is written by men. In addition, although there are specific guidelines of verifiability, notability, and neutral point of view that must be adhered by Wikipedia content, these guidelines are supervised and enforced by men. In this paper, we propose that gender bias is not about participation and representation only, but also about characterization of women. We approach the analysis of gender bias by defining a methodology for comparing the characterizations of men and women in biographies in three aspects: meta-data, language, and network structure. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the off-line world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in feminist theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.},

A 2008 survey conducted by the Wikimedia Foundation and United Nations University at Maastricht is the source of a frequently cited statistic that less than 13\% of Wikipedia contributors are female. However, the same study suggested that only 39.9\% of Wikipedia readers in the US were female – a finding contradicted by a representative survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center conducted less than two months later. Combining these two datasets through an application and extension of a propensity score estimation technique used to model survey non-response bias, we construct revised estimates, contingent on explicit assumptions, for several of the Wikimedia Foundation and United Nations University at Maastricht claims about Wikipedia editors. We estimate that the proportion of female US adult editors was 27.5\% higher than the original study reported (22.7\%, versus 17.8\%), and that the total proportion of female editors was 26.8\% higher (16.1\%, versus 12.7\%).},

However, the narrow diversity of the Wikipedia editor community has the potential to introduce systemic biases such as gender biases into the content of Wikipedia. In this paper we aim to tackle a sub problem of this larger challenge by presenting and applying a computational method for assessing gender bias on Wikipedia along multiple dimensions. We find that while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed. We hope our work contributes to increasing awareness about gender biases online, and in particular to raising attention to the different levels in which gender biases can manifest themselves on the web.},

Wikidata is a growing, open community database which can serve this purpose and also provides tight integration with Wikipedia. In order to improve the state of biological data, facilitate data management and dissemination, we imported all human and mouse genes, and all human and mouse proteins into Wikidata. In total, 59,530 human genes and 73,130 mouse genes have been imported from NCBI and 27,662 human proteins and 16,728 mouse proteins have been imported from the Swissprot subset of UniProt. As Wikidata is open and can be edited by anybody, our corpus of imported data serves as the starting point for integration of further data by scientists, the Wikidata community and citizen scientists alike. The first use case for this data is to populate Wikipedia Gene Wiki infoboxes directly from Wikidata with the data integrated above. This enables immediate updates of the Gene Wiki infoboxes as soon as the data in Wikidata is modified. Although Gene Wiki pages are currently only on the English language version of Wikipedia, the multilingual nature of Wikidata allows for a usage of the data we imported in all 280 different language Wikipedias. Apart from the Gene Wiki infobox use case, a powerful SPARQL endpoint and up to date exporting functionality (e.g. JSON, XML) enable very convenient further use of the data by scientists. In summary, we created a fully open and extensible data resource for human and mouse molecular biology and biochemistry data. This resource enriches all the Wikipedias with structured information and serves as a new linking hub for the biological semantic web.},

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors. In accord with these provisions, the  International Journal of Communication  believes in the vigorous assertion and defense of Fair Use by scholars engaged in academic research, teaching and non-commercial publishing. Thus, we view the inclusion of “quotations” from existing print, visual, audio and audio-visual texts to be appropriate examples of Fair Use, as are reproductions of visual images for the purpose of scholarly analysis. We encourage authors to obtain appropriate permissions to use materials originally produced by others, but do not require such permissions as long as the usage of such materials falls within the boundaries of Fair Use.},

    abstract = {<p>Wikipedia is a huge global repository of human knowledge that can be leveraged to investigate interwinements between cultures. With this aim, we apply methods of Markov chains and Google matrix for the analysis of the hyperlink networks of 24 Wikipedia language editions, and rank all their articles by PageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. Using automatic extraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical figures, for each edition and for each algorithm. We investigate their spatial, temporal, and gender distributions in dependence of their cultural origins. Our study demonstrates not only the existence of skewness with local figures, mainly recognized only in their own cultures, but also the existence of global historical figures appearing in a large number of editions. By determining the birth time and place of these persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution of such figures through 35 centuries of human history for each language, thus recovering interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain the distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting geographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical figures who appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures, we construct a network of cultures and identify the most influential cultures according to this network.</p>},

abstract ={Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

	abstract = {The Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development's Gender, Institutions and Development Data Base (GID‐DB) is a new cross‐country research tool with comprehensive measures of gender equality. It improves upon existing sources because it is the only data base on gender that systematically incorporates indicators of social norms, traditions and family law. The GID‐DB thereby permits analysis of hypotheses that link cultural practices to gender equality, human development and economic growth. A cross‐country comparison of the data indicates that inequalities in social institutions are particularly pronounced in countries with low female literacy rates, but correlate less strongly with Gross Domestic Product per capita. Similarly, our econometric analysis suggests a clearly negative correlation between gender inequality of the OECD Development Center and women's labor‐force participation.*The views expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the authors *The views expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the authors},

Relying on a framework that synthesizes key guidelines concerning the methodology of measurement, this article offers an assessment of indices currently used to study gender disparities on a global scale and sheds light on these unresolved questions. We answer two questions—what do these indices with gender-differentiated data actually measure? and, how valid are these indices?—and discuss the implications of our assessment for users and producers of gender indices.},

Although others have pointed to bias inparticular computer systems and have noted the general problem, we know of no comparable work that examines this phenomenon comprehensively and which offers a framework for understanding and remedying it. We conclude by suggesting that freedom from bias should by counted amoung the select set of criteria—including reliability, accuracy, and efficiency—according to which the quality of systems in use in society should be judged.},

This book grounds the education of women and girls in the realities of their lives and experiences in diverse areas of the developing world. The chapters all draw on substantial experience in the field, giving a voice to groups of girls and women hitherto invisible. Many present new perspectives on previously ignored problems and social groups by policy-malers, aid agencies and academics. They move beyond the previous emphasis on access to problematize the content of education and the way it is experienced. The case studies range from the Arakambut of Peru - an indigenous group whose knowledge of biodiversity is being threatened by formal education - to the changing experience of racialized education in South Africa. The book also presents a critical theoretical analysis of the World Bank's view of women's education. It unpacks the ways in which the Bank - the largest single source for funding of education - both conceptualizes and realizes its educational priorities. The contributors take issue with the view that education for girls and women is important primarily as a cost-effective mechanism for making women more economically productive. They ask why gender gap remains as wide as ever, in a decade where access to education has improved so dramatically."},
